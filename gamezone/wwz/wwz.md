# WWZ - How to Survive [Guide]

![home](./resources/home_wwz.jpg)

## Brief

The game is a cooperative third-person shooter in which four players fight against massive hordes of 
zombies in 4 Cities 

##  Dev Team

Saber Interactive began the game's development after one of their teams completed the production of a Halo game. Approximately 100 people worked on the game. The studio decided to use the World War Z license for the game as they felt that there were too many risks involved in marketing a brand new intellectual property. Left 4 Dead also inspired the developer when they were crafting the game's gameplay. A proprietary game engine named the Swarm Engine was used to power the game and render the huge zombie hordes.

## Maps

* New York
* Jerusalem
* Moscow
* Tokyo
* Marseille (DLC)

Sydney, Oslo, Barcelona, Denver, Cairo, Seoul, Budapest, Auckland, Buenos Aires, Manila, Paris and Johannesburg (not implemented in the game).

## Classes

Players can choose between six classes.

* the Gunslinger
* the Hellraiser 
* the Fixer
* the Medic 
* the Slasher
* the Exterminator
* the DroneMaster (new update)

## Perks 

They can be unlocked for each of the classes as players progress in the game.

When you reach `level 30`, you have the choice to upgrade your `Prestige`and rollback your level to 1.

For now there are 5 levels to prestige in order to unlock all your `class` perks. (5 x 30 levels).

##  My Perks Suggestions 

Tested in Insane and Extreme mode with random pickup match making

## Gunslinger (AK)

### Overview 

#### Before 'DroneMaster' update 07/22/2020: 

Gunslinger after the patch seem balanced to require more dexterity when shooting in order to take full
advantaged of aiming perks.

#### Tips

As an accurate ranged type class, it detect and mark special infected.

Custom game play can switch between both :

* [Annihilator] Primary, secondary and heavy weapons deal 15% more damage.

* [Job Satisfaction] Killing 15 zombies in rapid succession grants a temporary health boost.

### Overview

#### Before 'DroneMaster' update 07/22/2020: 

It seems that, after the patch update, hellraiser perks balance suggest to play more mine, than C4.
(I haven't tried to new perks set yet). 

#### Tips

Mixe up for Shotgun and C4

Custom game play can switch between both :

* [Hole Punch] Shotgun range increased by 50%.

* [Secret Ingredient] Stim Pistol grants additional masking effect lasting 5 seconds.
* [Swapping Mags!] SMGs' reload speed increased by 25%.

### Overview

#### Before 'DroneMaster' update 07/22/2020: 

Medic used to be a support classe, now the balance give it more solo action capabilities.
Efficiency is a game saver, but it nerfed down to balance more difficulties for the game

#### Tips

Custom game play can switch between both :

* 25% chance of using the Stim Pistol without depleting its charge.
* Killing 15 zombies in rapid succession gives 25% chance to refill one equipment charge.

* [My Round II] Increases the carried ammo capacity for heavy weapons by 10% for the entire team.

### Overview

#### Before 'DroneMaster' update 07/22/2020: 

Before update it was pretty easy to duplicate the supply bags, it seems that after the update
saber did balance and fix this duplication tricks making sometime the last defense part too easy.

#### Tips

There is two way to play fixer, according to the Team level:
- first fully support using smoke screen as masking grenade
- fully support with Supply exploding amo bags


## Slasher 

* [All Elbows] Decreases the movement speed penalty when zombies are very close by 100%.

* [Spare Batteries] The Stun Gun max capacity is increased to 4.
* [Adrenaline] Reload speed increased by 50% when health is below 25%.

### Overview

There are some perks which suggest that Slasher would use SMG, actually I'm playing it with any kind of guns.

#### Tips

Custom game play can switch between both :

* [All Elbows] Decreases the movement speed penalty when zombies are very close by 100%.
* [Rooted] Increases the number of zombies required to pin down the character from 8 to 12.

(In case you play melee as last resource, I would suggest to use masking ability in order to get out of trouble. Be aware that more you can handle the crowd control, keep zombie in distance, less you will risk to get hit)

* [Vigour] Killing 10 zombies in rapid succession with a melee weapon grants a temporary health boost. The ability has a 30 seconds cooldown.
* [Cloak and Dagger] Killing 10 zombies in rapid succession with a melee weapon grants a masking effect. The ability has a 30 seconds cooldown.

(automatically stands up can be a game saver, if your team use to fall. But it wont save you from protecting the objectifs, because when someone die, you will lose the Horde DPS)

* [Heavy Metal I] The character starts with an improved Forrest Warrior Chainsaw, dealing 50% more damage and having 50% more fuel. All Forest Warrior Chainsaw pickups are also improved.
* [Battle Cry] The character automatically stands up from being pinned after 5 seconds.

* [Deep Pockets] Carried ammo capacity for primary and secondary weapons is increased by 25%.

* [Bullet Rain] All fully automatic weapons' reload speed is increased by 25%.
* [Pickpocket] Killing 15 zombies in rapid succession gives a 25% chance to restore one charge of your equipment.
* [Ghost] Automatically receive masking effect if you are the last of your team still standing. Does not apply if you are incapacitated or pinned down.

### Overview

Arrived to level 16, a good Exterminator, should have the skill which allows to restore / duplicate a defense kit.

#### Tips

Quite fun class which is able to make some solo actions.


## Dronemaster

* [Longshot] Quadrocopter's attack range increased by 100% (base: 2 meters for stun gun, 15 meters for pistol).
* [Lightning Storm] Your Quadrocopter's stun gun's fire rate is increased by 50%.

* [Eye In The Sky] All active special zombies within a radius 14 meters around your Quadrocopter will be automatically marked.
* [Pocket Factory] You won't be able to pick equipment bags on the mission but your equipment will be constantly regenerating (150 seconds to replenish to maximum).
* [Next Best Thing] Start with Geist 17MP machine pistol as secondary weapon	

### Overview

This new class, act like a support, it can cover itself or a partner.
I suggest to upgrade weapons with silencer before to play this class 
(because it doesn't really have bonnus until mid-end level).

#### Tips

I mainly use the tazer energy, in order to keep the drone as long as possible.
and positionning the drone at strategic spot to cover my blind spot.
I would recommand [Next Best Thing] if you can buy the machine pistol at (1000 blue coins)
