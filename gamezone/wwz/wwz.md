# WWZ - How to Survive [Guide]

![home](./resources/home_wwz.jpg)

## Brief

The game is a cooperative third-person shooter in which four players fight against massive hordes of 
zombies in 4 Cities 

##  Dev Team

Saber Interactive began the game's development after one of their teams completed the production of a Halo game. Approximately 100 people worked on the game. The studio decided to use the World War Z license for the game as they felt that there were too many risks involved in marketing a brand new intellectual property. Left 4 Dead also inspired the developer when they were crafting the game's gameplay. A proprietary game engine named the Swarm Engine was used to power the game and render the huge zombie hordes.

## Maps
