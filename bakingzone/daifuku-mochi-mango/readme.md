# Daifuku Mochi - Creamy Mango

Inspired by japanese dessert (Strawberry Daifuku), here is my version.
This preparation is for 12 pieces of mochi skins (~30g each, ~7cm diameter).
For this recipe I've already lower the usage of sugar, and fat compare to some other recipes. _(balancing with fruit natural sugar)_

## Ingredients

* 2 Mangos

### Dough

* 140g Rice Flour
* 40g Sugar
* 30g Corn starch
* 1 pinch of Salt

* 175ml Milk
* 35g Butter (unsalted)

### Whipped Cream

* 400ml Whipped Cream _(frosting)_ (Important: at least 30%+ milk fat)*
* 40g Sugar
* 20g Flour (Baked)
* 1/2 tea spoon Vanilla Extract

## Processing

* Cut the Mango into dice pieces. _(actually you can put any fruits you like)_

### Dough

#### Part 1

1. Sieve in a bowl _(to avoid lumps)_, respectively: Rice Flour, sugar, Corn starch, salt.
2. Use a whisk to mix it.
3. Open a well _(in the middle)_ to pour in the milk gradually while stiring.
4. Mix evenly, it is ready when it dripped without leaving any trace or lines.
5. Sieve the mixture into shallow plate to reduce steaming time. _(remove the air bubble by tapping gently the recipient on the table)_.
6. Steam them on boiling water. _(prevent water vaper from dripping down covering the preparation)_.
7. Steam on High Heat for 20mins. _(using a shallow plate)_.
8. It's cooked when it is a bit translucent light beige color _(sticky)_.
9. Melt 35g of unsalted butter by scraping the dough when it still hot (warning it is VERY HOT!).
10. Make the butter incorporate to the dough.
11. Knead the dough about ~10mins _(without tearing it apart)_ .
12. It must become really smooth, let it chill into normal temperature.
13. Make a small ball to put into plastic wrap. 
14. Ready to put into fridge for (30min).

_(at this moment you can prepare the fruits, and also prepare the whipped cream into freezer for ~15 to 20mins)_

#### Part 2

1. On a clean flat surface, apply dust of cornstarch _(to prevent from sticky)_.
2. Unwrap your dough, apply some dust cornstach on it.
3. Cut it into 12 pieces _(~30g per piece)_, flatten it to make a ball.
4. Press with your hand then roll it flat to make a circle _(the wrap)_.
5. Apply on both side cornstarch _(prevent from sticky)_, stack them into plastic wrap _(prevent from dryness)_

### Whipped Cream

_(Who never prepared Sweet Whipped Cream, milk fat should be at least 30% minimum, under it will be pain in the ass nearly impossible to obtain a consistent result)_

1. Pour the whipped cream into a _(frozen)_ bowl. 
2. Whip the cream to incorporate as much air as you can.
3. When the cream become more firm, add some sugar.
4. Continue to Whip, add the baked flour and Vanilla extract.
5. Whip until it become really firm (stiff peaks).

For Information: Well wipped cream, you might be able to turn upside down, without making it fall _(with no motion)_

### Assembling

1. Place the wrap on a curve surface, using a dome (half sphere).
2. Fill around with a layer of frozen cream.
3. Stuff with mango fruits
4. Complete & fill wholes with frozen cream.
5. Wrap the bottom in order to close it. (Seal it like a dumpling)
6. Cut off the excess

You can present it into a round container (after put on fridge or freezer for 2 hours).

## Tips & Tricks

### Dough

- You can reduce the size by 2 if you desire to make a mouthful piece of mochi. (becareful it's more delicate on the wrapping part).

### Whipped Cream

The key of a good whipped cream: working in **COLD environment**, and high percentage of milk fat (at least 30% milk fat).

The case that your cream is still liquid after 10mins of whipping: 

- Prepare a bowl of water + salt + ice pack (in order to lower the temperature the freezing should be about -21°C instead of 0°C). Then put in it  the bowl of your whip cream to finish the process. _(Tips that I use in summer weather without aircon in the kitchen)_

- You can add some `mascarpone`: italian cream cheese rich in milk fat. (That could save the recipe).
